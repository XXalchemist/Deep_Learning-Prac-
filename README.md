## What is Neural Network

Neural network is model that is used to recognise complex pattern in data. It is inspired by the biological neural network that constitutes human. It consist of multiple layers and every layer have two main attributes :- Nodes (as Neurons) and Edges (as the connection between the nodes).

**Some Examples :-**

#### Neural Network used for labelled data(Supervised Learning) :-
`Text Processing (RNTN)` `Image Recognition (CNN, DBN)` `Object Recognition (RNTN, CNN)` `Speech Recognition (RNN)`

#### Neural Network used for Unlabelled data(Unsupervised Learning) :-
`Feature Extraction (RBM)` `Pattern Recognition (Autoencoders)` `
