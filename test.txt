Joker is, without a doubt, one of the best movies produced. In my opinion, it succeeded in attacking real-world violence and in the portrayal of mental illness. Joaquin Phoenix's acting in this movie is outstanding, and I cannot think of any person who could have done it better. This movie pushes the limits on what you can do with a classic comic book character, and I loved it.
However, parents and just anyone interested in this movie should know that Joker is a very dark film. It does not compare to movies like Pulp Fiction in any of its contained parts, despite what some parts of the movie media will say, but it is still very violent. The main character, Arthur Fleck, has a mental illness that was directly caused by all of the trauma he experienced throughout his life, whether it be physical, social, or emotional. The streets of Gotham are dangerous, and Arthur is under abuse by many people. The movie could not only be considered disturbing because of violence level (i.e. shootings, car crash, brutal beatings, gory stabbings) but because of the mental degradation of Arthur Fleck as the story moves along. This especially comes when the person who Arthur admires (not going to say his name yet just so no spoilers) publicly shames him on television, shattering his dreams. Arthur's mind starts on a downward spiral, and he eventually becomes a sort of a psychopath.
Some parts of the media say that Joker may end up calling all the mentally unstable or broken people out and that they will end up killing people, but I disagree. This movie is not for everyone, and some may end up seriously perturbed by this movie, but if you can push through all of that, you can watch the best movie of 2019.
As for the sex, there is kissing, nude photos briefly glimpsed when a notebook is gone through, and porno theatre ad signs that contain suggestive messages. Really not much if you are mature. Smoking is everywhere, and the main character smokes. Prescription meds are given to Arthur by a medical professional for his mental illness as well. Swearing includes f**k, s**t, a**, a**hole, prick, and variations of a few. There are really not many good role models, considering that even the main character ends up turning into a psycho, but some messages can be considered good. "Put on a happy face" is an expression used in the film, and has a prevalence throughout it, and is a good suggestion for real-life considering, although it could be taken to an extreme by some.
I recommend that non-adults should be at least 14+ if they are somewhat mature, but immature non-adults should be 16+. Considering me as a child, I was hyper-mature and very intelligent. I would have watched this at 11, maybe 12, but not many should watch it at that age if they are not mature. The majority of non-adults should be 14+, in my opinion.
Like I said before, this is a great movie, but it isn't for everyone. I found it to be the best movie of 2019, and if a daresay, my favorite movie of all time. Joaquin Phoenix is by far the best Joker, surpassing even Heath Ledger (RIP).
If you are a Joker fan, you must watch this movie.
